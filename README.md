# Movie-Recommender-System_Python
Building a content-based movie recommender system involves recommending movies based on their features and attributes. Here are some objectives you can consider for creating a content-based movie recommender system in Python and Implement algorithms to calculate the similarity between movies based on their features. Common methods include cosine similarity for text data .

# Steps Followed 
Data Collection: Gather a dataset containing information about movies, including features like genres, directors, actors, and plot summaries.

Data Preprocessing:Clean and preprocess the dataset by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and transforming text data.

Feature Extraction:Extract relevant features from the dataset, such as movie genres, directors, and actors.

Text Vectorization:Convert text data (e.g., plot summaries) into numerical vectors using techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings.

Similarity Calculation:Use similarity metrics (e.g., cosine similarity) to calculate the similarity between movies based on their features.

Data Visualization: Utilize libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly for creating various types of plots.

Visualize trends, patterns, and insights in data through graphs and charts.
